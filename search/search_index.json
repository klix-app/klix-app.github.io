Full up-to-date REST API Reference can be found here . OpenAPI document that can be used to generate API client can be found here . In order to call Klix API you should first receive API credentials (Brand ID and Secret Key) from Klix representative. API usage in single payment scenario \u00b6 Single payment step by step guide \u00b6 Get list of payment methods (optional). This API end-point returns name and logo of each payment method available to merchant (Klix Card payments, Citadele and other bank PSD2 payments etc.). Use this list to render a payment methods page on your site. Create a purchase by submitting order data to Klix. Once purchase is created link to Klix hosted payment page will be returned as checkout_url field value. After customer is redirected to this page Klix will handle a payment process. Handle one of possible payment process outcomes: If customer payment is successful then callback is sent to merchant server and customer is redirected to successful purchase page specified by merchant. Note that you should consider purchase as successfully paid only after callback is received and purchase status is checked. Note that in case if callback is not used you can call Klix API to get purchase status once customer is redirected back to successful purchase page. If customer payment fails for some reason customer is redirected to failed purchase page. If cancelled payment redirect URL is specified in purchase creation request then customer will be able to go back to merchant page from Klix payment page. It's preferable to specify checkout/payment method selection page as cancelled payment redirect URL so that customer can make adjustments in shopping cart or choose different payment method. Single payment request examples \u00b6 These are simple request examples that illustrate Klix API usage. Always use API Reference as a single source of truth. Note that <Brand ID goes here> and <Secret key goes here> should be replaced with actual Brand ID and Secret Key received from Klix contact person.

Created purchase id and checkout_url will be returned in response. Redirect customer to checkout_url and Klix will handle a payment process. Store this initial purchase id on your side as a recurring payment token and use it later on to charge a customer payment card (see <Recurring payment token> placeholder in example ). If purchase created in previous step is paid by customer then card details are successfully captured for subsequent use. Once customer card should be charged in a form of a recurring payment new purchase should be created via API by specifying amount that needs to be charged and transaction description. This time force_recurring should be false or can be omitted at all (see example ). In this case only purchase id returned in response should be used in next step (see <Purchase id of recurring payment> placeholder in example ). Note that checkout_url should not be used. Created purchase should be charged via API call. Note that both newly created purchase id created in step 2 and recurring payment token (purchase id ) created in step 1 should be passed to this API end-point (see example ). Request examples \u00b6 These are simple request examples that illustrate Klix API usage. Always use API Reference as a single source of truth. Note that <Brand ID goes here> and <Secret key goes here> should be replaced with actual Brand ID and Secret Key received from Klix contact person. Create an initial purchase to register card for subsequent recurring payments \u00b6 This should be done only once to make initial payment and register customer card for subsequent use. curl -X POST \\ https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/ \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\ -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Host: portal.klix.app' \\ -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate' \\ -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\ -d '{ \"force_recurring\": true, \"success_callback\": \"https://your.site/api/successfully-paid-callback-will-be-sent-to-this-end-point\", \"success_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-of-successfull-payment\", \"failure_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-of-failed-payment\", \"cancel_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-customer-decides-to-go-back-to-your-store-during-payment\", \"purchase\": { \"language\": \"lv\", \"products\": [ { \"price\": 700, \"name\": \"XYZ service subscription\" } ] }, \"client\": { \"email\": \"test@test.com\" }, \"brand_id\": \"<Brand ID goes here>\", \"reference\": \"Your order id\" }' Create recurring payment \u00b6 This should be done for each recurring payment (e.g. each month). curl -X POST \\ https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/ \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\ -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Host: portal.klix.app' \\ -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate' \\ -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\ -d '{ \"success_callback\": \"https://your.site/api/successfully-paid-callback-will-be-sent-to-this-end-point\", \"purchase\": { \"language\": \"lv\", \"products\": [ { \"price\": 700, \"name\": \"XYZ service subscription fee for December 2020\" } ] }, \"client\": { \"email\": \"test@test.com\" }, \"brand_id\": \"<Brand ID goes here>\", \"reference\": \"Your order id\" }' Charge customer card as a recurring payment \u00b6 curl -X POST \\ https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/<Purchase id of recurring payment>/charge \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\ -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Host: portal.klix.app' \\ -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate' \\ -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\ -d '{ \"recurring_token\": \"<Recurring payment token>\" }' API usage in reservation scenario (payment execution separated from authorization) \u00b6 Reservation step by step guide \u00b6 Create a purchase by submitting order data and additional skip_capture flag to Klix indicating card payment authorization separation from payment execution. Once purchase is created link to Klix hosted payment page will be returned as checkout_url field value. Payment identifier returned in purchase creation response should be stored for later use in capture or release requests. After customer is redirected to this page Klix will capture customer card details and will reserve the funds equal to purchase total amount. There are several options how to proceed with reservation: Charge reserved amount. There's an option to either charge full reserved amount or amount that's smaller than initially reserved amount. Release (return to customer) reserved amount. Automatic release of reserved amount Reservations are released automatically after 6 days if charge request is not received within this period. Reservation functionality request examples \u00b6 These are simple request examples that illustrate Klix API usage. Always use API Reference as a single source of truth. Note that <Brand ID goes here> and <Secret key goes here> should be replaced with actual Brand ID and Secret Key received from Klix contact person. Create a reservation purchase \u00b6 This option allows to create a purchase that will reserve purchase total amount in case of card payment. Store purchase id returned in response to either change or release funds reserved by this purchase. Redirect customer to checkout_url returned in purchase creation response to allow customer to enter card details. Note that in case of successful reservation purchase status will be changed to \"hold\" instead of \"paid\" as in case of regular card payment. curl -X POST \\ https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/ \\ -H 'Accept: application/json' \\ -H 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' \\ -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \\ -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ -H 'Host: portal.klix.app' \\ -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate' \\ -H 'cache-control: no-cache' \\ -d '{ \"success_callback\": \"https://your.site/api/successfully-paid-callback-will-be-sent-to-this-end-point\", \"success_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-of-successfull-payment\", \"failure_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-of-failed-payment\", \"cancel_redirect\": \"https://your.site/customer-will-be-redirected-here-in-case-customer-decides-to-go-back-to-your-store-during-payment\", \"purchase\": { \"language\": \"lv\", \"products\": [ { \"price\": 3000, \"name\": \"Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5\" }, { \"price\": 100, \"name\": \"Screen protector for Xiaomi Mi Smart Band 5\" } ] }, \"skip_capture\": true, \"client\": { \"email\": \"test@test.com\" }, \"payment_method_whitelist\": [\"klix\"], \"brand_id\": \"<Brand ID goes here>\", \"reference\": \"Your order id\" }' Charge funds reserved by previously created purchase \u00b6 To change full amount previously reserved by specified purchase no request body should be sent. <Purchase ID> is purchase identifier (field id value) received in purchase creation response. curl --location --request POST 'https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/<Purchase ID>/capture/' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' Charge partial funds reserved by previously created purchase \u00b6 To change amount that's smaller than previously reserved amount this new amount should be specified in request. <Purchase ID> is purchase identifier (field id value) received in purchase creation response. curl --location --request POST 'https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/<Purchase ID>/capture/' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' \\ --data-raw '{ \"amount\": 5 } ' Release funds reserved by previously created purchase \u00b6 To release funds reserved by Purchase following request should be sent: curl --location --request POST 'https://portal.klix.app/api/v1/purchases/<Purchase ID>/release/' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\ --header 'Authorization: Bearer <Secret key goes here>' Klix Pay Later monthly payment widget \u00b6 In order to add Klix Pay Later monthly payment widget to your store place following script in head part of the page. < head > <!-- Klix Pay Later widget --> < script type = \"module\" src = \"https://klix.blob.core.windows.net/public/pay-later-widget/build/klix-pay-later-widget.esm.js\" ></ script > < script nomodule = \"\" src = \"https://klix.blob.core.windows.net/public/pay-later-widget/build/klix-pay-later-widget.js\" ></ script > </ head > Then place Klix Pay Later monthly payment widget source code just below the product price.
